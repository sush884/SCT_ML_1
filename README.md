# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

## 📖 Overview  
This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on key features such as:  
- 📏 Square footage (`GrLivArea`)  
- 🛏️ Number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)  
- 🛁 Number of bathrooms (`FullBath`)  

The model is trained and evaluated on a housing dataset to estimate property prices.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- `GrLivArea` – Total square footage of the house  
- `BedroomAbvGr` – Number of bedrooms above ground  
- `FullBath` – Number of full bathrooms  
- `SalePrice` – Target variable (house price)  

👉 Place your dataset as `train.csv` and `test.csv` inside the project folder.
